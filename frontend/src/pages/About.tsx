            <p>I am a full-stack software developer with a background in applied and computational physics, now fully transitioning into software development. My expertise lies in problem-solving, efficient coding, and architecting scalable applications, backed by strong knowledge of version control, CI/CD workflows, and modern web technologies.</p>

            <p>Currently, I work at the University of Turku, where I apply my analytical mindset to tackle complex challenges. Beyond my professional role, I am the creator of <a className="font-bold bg-gradient-to-r from-teal-300 via-blue-300 to-pink-300 bg-clip-text text-transparent text-center select-auto transition-all duration-1000 hover:bg-gradient-to-r hover:from-pink-300 hover:via-blue-300 hover:to-teal-300" href="https://laina-de.fi">Laina</a>, a decentralized finance project that won a $10,000 award in the <a className="font-bold bg-gradient-to-r from-teal-300 via-blue-300 to-pink-300 bg-clip-text text-transparent text-center select-auto transition-all duration-1000 hover:bg-gradient-to-r hover:from-pink-300 hover:via-blue-300 hover:to-teal-300" href="https://communityfund.stellar.org/kickstart"> Stellar Kickstart</a> competition. Through Laina, I have gained hands-on experience in blockchain development, smart contracts, and financial technology, reinforcing my passion for cutting-edge innovation.</p>

            <p>I have a solid foundation in Rust, TypeScript, Python, and React, among other technologies, and I am constantly exploring new tools and frameworks to expand my skill set. My approach to software development is pragmatic, detail-oriented, and focused on delivering efficient, user-friendly solutions. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working on projects that push technical boundaries while solving real-world problems.</p>

            <p>I am eager to contribute my skills to impactful projects, continue growing as a developer, and build software that makes a difference.</p>
